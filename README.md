<h1>BASIC C# PROJECTS<h1>

<h3>Here are some projects I made using C# and the .NET framework.</h3>
  
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Car Insurance</li>
    <li>Twenty One</li>
    <li>Student Database</li>
    <li>Shipping Quote</li>
    <li>Daily Report</li>
    <li>Income Program</li>
    <li>Date Time</li>
  </ul>
  
<h2>Car Insurance</h2>
In this project I used C# and the MVC and ASP.NET framework to create a website and database for car insurance companies. This website allows users to fill out a form online and will calculate an accurate car insurance quote based on the user's age, vehicle, and driving record. I also built a view that allows site administrators to see all of the quotes as well as the associated names and email addresses tied to the insurance quote. 

<h2>Twenty One</h2>
This project contains a fully functioning card game of 21 using C# in a console application.  The game automatically shuffles cards and allows users to play the dealer as long as they have enough money.  This game contains many fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming like polymorphism, inheritance, and abstraction.  

<h2>Student Database</h2>
This project is a basic Entity Framework Code-First app that creates a basic Student database and adds one student to the database.
  
<h2>Shipping Quote</h2>
In this project I built a console app that asks the user for dimensions and weight of their package to determine whether they can ship it or not.  If the box is shippable the app will then give the user a shipping quote.

<h2>Daily Report</h2>
This project uses a console app to ask users for input at the end of the day. The app uses casting to convert user answers to the appropriate data type.
  
<h2>Income Program</h2>
In this project I used a console app to ask users for information about their income.  The app will compare the users data to a second users data and will determine which user makes more money.  

<h2>Date Time</h2>
This application displays the current Date and Time (DateTime.Now) and then asks the user to input a number.  The application then converts the user number into hours and adds them to the current time and displays the future time in the console.
